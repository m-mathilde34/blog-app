# Project Description

This project was created to cement my knowledge and skills over all things Web Development. Specifically, over Backend Web Development.

This was a Capstone Project from Dr. Angela Yu's *The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp* with the following brief :

***The goal of this project is to create a Blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create and view blog posts. Posts will not persist between sessions as no database will be used in this version of the application. Styling will be an important aspect of this project to ensure a good user experience.***

Whilst the instructions were given by Dr. Angela Yu, the code is entirely my own.

## Blog Features :

1. **Post Creation**: Users should be able to create new posts.

2. **Post Viewing** : The home page should allow the user to view all their posts.

3. **Post Update/Delete** : Users should be edit and delete posts as needed.

3. **Styling** : The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Deliverables :
1. One Node project for the function of the website

2. Including at least one EJS file for the structure of the website

3. Including at least one CSS file for the styling of the website
